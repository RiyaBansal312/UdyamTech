        <p>
          Aluminium is a soft and lightweight metal with a dull silver-gray appearance. It is about one-third as dense as steel or copper, making it highly malleable, ductile, and easy to machine and cast. Its excellent corrosion resistance and durability come from a protective oxide layer, making it both nonmagnetic and nonsparking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aluminium is the second most malleable metal after gold and the sixth most ductile. Its use exceeds that of any other metal except iron and it plays a vital role in nearly all segments of the global economy. Aluminium alloys are essential in aircraft and rocket construction due to their high strength-to-weight ratio.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, aluminium was once so rare and valuable that it was used for the apex of the Washington Monument—at a time when an ounce cost more than a day's wages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Initially, aluminium was extremely difficult to extract from ore, despite being abundant on Earth. It forms stable oxides that do not flake off like rust on steel. Ironically, the very feature that makes aluminium ideal for countless applications also made it incredibly hard to produce.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recycling has transformed the aluminium industry. Recovering it from scrap is significantly more energy-efficient than refining it from ore. Recycling consumes only 5% of the energy required to produce new aluminium. Though practiced since the early 1900s, aluminium recycling gained public awareness with the rise of beverage cans in the late 1960s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Producing aluminium is energy-intensive—electric power can account for 20% to 40% of total production costs. That’s why smelters are usually located near cheap and abundant power sources. As of 2004, China is the world’s largest aluminium producer.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#f5d67a] mt-10">Wrought Aluminium vs Wrought Iron</h2>

        <p>
          After its initial popularity in the 1920s, wrought aluminium faded during the vinyl-siding boom. Now, it’s making a major comeback over wrought iron thanks to its lower cost and new manufacturing techniques that replicate wrought iron’s aesthetics—without the maintenance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The resurgence is driven by architectural trends favoring Mediterranean, Southwestern, and French country styles. Advanced production methods now make aluminium applications more durable and attractive.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#f5d67a] mt-10">Gated Communities and Social Impact</h2>

        <p>
          As gating becomes more widespread, the line between public and private space continues to blur. Developers recognize that gated communities enhance property values, and municipalities appreciate the resulting boost in property tax revenue.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to the 2001 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey, over 7 million households—or roughly 6% of the national total—live in gated communities. In the West, that number jumped by 11%.
        </p>

        <p>
          These communities are often upscale and demographically homogeneous. Originally limited to high-end areas like Rolling Hills and Bradbury in 1930s Los Angeles, gated communities now dominate nearly 50% of the market in desert resort regions like Palm Springs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, gated living is no longer exclusive to the elite. These developments are now tailored for all market segments within the middle and upper classes, continuously expanding across the country.
